##  Dashboard Analysis: Key Scenarios & Insights
This section showcases several analytical scenarios derived from the interactive dashboard. Each scenario represents a filtered view of the data, uncovering specific trends and patterns related to road safety.

## Scenario 1: The "Fatal Accidents" 
This view filters the entire dataset to show only accidents that resulted in a fatality, allowing for an analysis of the most severe incidents.

**Insight**: Fatal accidents are fewer but occur more frequently on weekends, especially Saturdays, indicating a higher severity risk during weekends despite more accidents on weekdays.

## Scenario 2: The "Weekend Danger"
This view isolates all accidents that occurred on a Saturday or Sunday to analyze if and how they differ from weekday accidents.

**Insight**: Weekend accidents are less frequent but more severe, with a higher proportion of fatal and serious cases compared to weekdays.

## Scenario 3: The "Adverse Weather"
This view focuses on accidents that happened during non-ideal weather conditions, such as rain, snow, or fog.

**Insight**: Accidents during rain or snow are less frequent but often more severe. These incidents are mainly concentrated in urban areas with higher traffic density.

## Scenario 4: The "Urban vs. Rural"
This analysis compares the characteristics of accidents in urban areas versus those in rural areas, revealing two very different safety profiles.

**Rural Accidents View:**

**Insight**: A clear divide exists between urban and rural accidents. Urban areas account for the vast majority of total accidents, but rural accidents are disproportionately more severe. The percentage of 'Fatal' outcomes is significantly higher in rural areas, likely due to higher average speeds and potentially longer emergency response times

## Scenario 5: Year-Over-Year Comparison 
We use the "Year" slicer. First, select only "2021" for the first screenshot, then select only "2022" for the second.

**2021 View**

**2022 View**

**Insight**: A year-over-year comparison shows a [slight increase/decrease] in total accidents from 2021 to 2022. The total number of casualties also saw a corresponding [increase/decrease], indicating that road safety trends remained relatively stable/worsened/improved over the period.
